## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

I have worked with a lot of technologies, to list them all here would be too cumbersome. Therefore I created a [Tech Radar Page](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmunichbughunter%2Ftech-radar%2Fmain%2FPatricks%2520Tech%2520Radar.json) where you can find my technologies.
